This is an attempt to recreate the AWBW app in React. It is currently under development as the author (myself) learns to use Next.js while slowly porting.

### Installed Software Versions
- Node version: v16.14.0
- Yarn version: 3.1.1

### Quickstart
Ensure you have the latest LTS version of `node` and `yarn`. You can install
them using using the package manager for your system by following the
instruction found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). If
for some reason yarn isn't installed along with node, you can manually install
it by following [these](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
instructions.

You can then run the app locally by doing

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev
```

and navigating to `localhost:3000` on your web browser.
